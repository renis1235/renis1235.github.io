Such systems require more specialization since human lives and business futures can be at stake. Building high quality software became natural through the many projects that this study course provided. Here is a list of the most relevant courses:</p><ul><li>Data Analysis & Mining</li><li>Advanced IT Security</li><li>Quantum Information Science & Quantum Programming</li><<li>Simulation Methods</li><li>Internet of Things</li><li>Cloud Computing</li><li>Homomorphic Encryption</li></ul><p>Master's Thesis was a hands-on project related to <strong>Authentication and Authorization of Microservices.</strong>. The thesis included Mutual TLS, Microservices in C++ and the further implementation of an already existing Simulation Software.</p>",
