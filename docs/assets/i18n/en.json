  "service1Paragraph": "I am a Software Developer which has a passion for code and 5 years of University to back my knowledge up. In my 3 years of Bachelor and 2 years of Master I have implemented many different projects in many different technologies. I ended up loving <b>Java</b> and <b>Angular</b> to work on my professional projects.",

  "service3Paragraph": "Being a full-stack developer has sharpened my front-end skills too. I have written my first <b>JavaScript</b> line of code back in 2015 and switched over to <b>TypeScript</b> since I find it more structured. Angular is also one of the reasons for choosing typescript.",

My academic background includes a Computer Science Bachelors from the University of Tirana. I’m originally from Albania, a small country, but with amazing potential!. Soon after, I moved to Germany full-time and started my Master’s in the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences for High Integrity Systems. And the rest is history...or is it?!",

  "timeline6": "<h4>Finished Bachelor on Computer Science/Informatics</h4><p>Even though I could code before starting my studies, the three years of my Bachelor Studies deepened my knowledge on several areas through the use of projects and live coding exercises. During these studies I managed to gain knowledge on the following subjects: <ul><li>Algorithms and Performance Optimizations</li><li>Database management and Query Optimizations</li><li>Java programming (SE & EE)</li><li>Vanilla Web Development (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)</li><li>C & C++ programming</li><li>Vanilla PHP programming</li><li>Networking basics & packet tracking tools</li><li>Best coding practices and different metholodies (SCRUM, Agile dev., etc)</li></ul></p>",
  "timeline7": "<h4>Move to Germany and begin my Studies on High Integrity Systems.</h4><p>Specialization on Safety Critical Systems, helped me to get a better insight on building high quality and fault tolerant software. Since building of these systems requires a lot more analysis than your normal web service, I gained a completely different mindset to structuring and validating/verifying high quality software. Also changing my environment from Albania to Germany helped broaden my horizon and get to know many different cultures. The strong points that I were able to obtain through my Master's are the following:</p><ul><li>Data Analysis</li><li>Data Mining</li><li>Modern Advanced IT Security methods</li><li>Real-Time systems management</li><li>Transaction Management - to completely conclude DBMS</li><li>Quantum Information Science & Programming with IBM's QisKit</li><li>Testing methods (applied in Python)</li><li>Human Machine Interaction (concluded with a project in Node.js and vanilla js)</li><li>Simulation Methods (Applied through MATLAB & SimuLink)</li><li>Internet of Things</li><li>Cloud Computing and the technologies behind it (AWS, Azure etc)</li><li>Homomorphic Encryption 10 Credit Project with Microsoft SEAL</li></ul><p>Currently working on my Master's Thesis on <strong>Authentication and Authorization of Microservices.</strong></p>",
